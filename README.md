# SRE/DevOps Take Home Test

## Introduction

Here is the readme file for the take home assignment. In this readme I will be going through the questions and my code and providing explanations, assumptions, and instructions, as well as hurdles that I had. 

I have also included comments in my python and terraform scripts to describe what I am doing in my code.

I did have to install Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 and 2 to be able to do a few of these questions.

### Bash

Part 1: Takes input for hostname, start port, and end port, then uses the netcat command to check the port range. A hurdle I had here was that I was using my work laptop to do this assignment, and I was connected to VPN, so I was having name resolution issues.

Part 2: Takes input for filename in the current directory, the regex, and the replacement string, then use the sed command (stream editor, used to do things like search, replace, insert, and delete), to replace the regex with the replacement string.

Part 3: Takes input for filename, a string, and the line number to insert the string at. Then we go through and count the number of lines within the file. I then created a function with a while loop in it that checks while the line number is less than the line count, use the sed command to insert the string at the desired line number. Then we increase the number of lines and line count due to the insertion, and we keep doing this until we reach end of file. Then I call the function and show the file with the modified contents

### Python

For this, I installed python on VS Code and ran my script via a python terminal within VS Code.

I have included comments in my code to break down what I am doing.

I was able to grab the author of the repo as well as the person with the most commits. However, I had trouble with counting "the number of commits which occurred during the period from July 1, 2018 â€“ Aug. 30, 2018 and print the total". 

In my code, I changed the dates from 2018 to 2020, and I was able to see results for changes that happened during that time period, however, for 2018, I was unable to pull up any commits. I then realized that my code was only going through 1 page of commits, and there were many pages, and unfortunately, I was unable to figure out how to go through all the pages of commits and count them. My code was only able to display the dates and times of the commits that happened between July 1 2020 - Aug 30 2020. Please see my output below.

### Terraform

This was probably the easiest part of the assignment for me.

I have included comments in my code to break down what I am doing.

Prior to running the terraform script. I installed the AWS CLI and performed an AWS configure and entered my secret key, access key, and region, I did this so that I would be authenticated to my AWS tenant that I created for myself. Within my code I still specified the key pair just as a best practice.

When the terraform apply is done, the user will get prompted to enter their IP address so that when the VM's are built, only that IP has SSH access to them. The user MUST enter their IP in the following format: 0.0.0.0/0

Once the terraform apply was ran, my environment was spun up and I was able to access both VM's via SSH and display the public and private IPs of each VM.

### Chef

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the chef client to work on my machine. I had spent hours troubleshooting and researching to see how I can get chef to work on my laptop but had no success. Even though I am submitting the assignment without the chef part being done, I will still try to get chef working and do the question for my own learning.

### Security

I installed Docker Desktop for Windows on my laptop.

I installed the git CLI on my machine and ran the following:

git clone https://github.com/marko999/metasploit2-docker.git

This cloned the Dockerfile and README.md to my directory

I then opened up Powershell and changed to the directory where the Dockerfile was and created the image by running the following:

docker build -t sepehr_metasploit .

Then ran the following to run the container:

docker run --name sepehr_container -it sepehr_metasploit

This is where I had issues. I needed to run a docker scan, however the results below showed that there were no vulnerabilities
, but in the assignment, it says that I need to list out 2 vulnerabilities

I then checked to see if there are any services running by running the following:

docker service ls

docker ps -a

But this did not return any services to me

I tried to do various things such as restarting docker, building a new image/container, trying different docker command switches, but to no avail, and unfortunately this was the farthest I could make it with this question
